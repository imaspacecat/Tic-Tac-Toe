# Tic-Tac-Toe
Pretty self explanatory, it's tic-tac-toe. 

Future features I plan to add:
-different computer difficulties
-the possibility to choose who starts (in single player).

How to run (with a shell): 
You need to have JRE (Java runtime environment) installed in order to run a java program. You can also just download the JDK which includes it.
Have access to terminal/cmd or some shell.

1. Download the .zip file of this program.
2. Unzip it.
3. Remember the name of the directory with the class files and in the shell type: cd myDirectory
4. Once you are in the directory type: java Main
5. If you've done everything correctly the program will start (some text will be printed. You'll know if it worked).

*Note: I am using bash so if you are using a different shell you might have to use a different command.

Alternatively you can run my program through the repl page: https://replit.com/@imaspacecat/Tic-Tac-Toe?v=1

If you find any bugs let me know!
